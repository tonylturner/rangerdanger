# Tool inventory - what's installed where, and how to decide

The lab ships student-facing CLI tools (`mbpoll`, `dnp3poll`, `nmap`,
`tcpdump`, etc.) across multiple Dockerfiles, each tailored to the
zone-position and persona of the host. Several recent audits have
shuffled tools between images - this doc is the cross-reference so
the next author doesn't have to re-derive it from `apt-get install`
lines, and the [decision tree](#deciding-where-to-add-a-new-tool)
gives a stable answer to "this command needs to run somewhere - which
image?"

Notes:

- **`mbpoll` on rtac-sim** is built from source against alpine's
  `libmodbus-dev` (`mbpoll-builder` stage) because it isn't in any
  alpine repo. The runtime image installs `libmodbus` to satisfy the
  dynamic link.
- **DNP3 tools** are built from the in-tree `dnp3go/` module via a
  `dnp3-builder` stage in each Dockerfile that needs them, then
  `COPY --from=dnp3-builder` into the runtime image. There is **no**
  apt/apk source for these - they're our own.
- **vendor-jump** installs both client (`openssh-server` provides the
  daemon; the OpenSSH server package on Ubuntu also drops `ssh` /
  `scp` clients via the `openssh-client` recommended dependency).

## Deciding where to add a new tool

Use this in PR review or before opening one. The rule of thumb is
**add the tool to the lowest-privilege host that legitimately runs
the command in the lab narrative**, not "wherever's most convenient
to apt install."

```
Is the tool an attack tool (used to violate the policy)?
    → Dockerfile.kali. Always.
    Examples: nmap, mbpoll (write-coil), dnp3cmd (Direct Operate),
              xfreerdp (compromise lab), sshpass (auth-bypass demo).

Is it an operator/engineer diagnostic the student would run from
the engineering workstation?
    → Dockerfile.eng-ws.
    Examples: wireshark (GUI), tshark, mbpoll (read-only), python3
              + pymodbus for ad-hoc scripts.

Is it a vendor-laptop tool - implies the vendor support persona has
it pre-installed?
    → Dockerfile.vendor-jump.
    Examples: dnp3poll for monitoring, RDP server for the foothold,
              tcpdump for vendor-side capture.

Is it a field-side diagnostic command the lab YAMLs run from a
specific simulator?
    → services/Dockerfile, in the matching sim's stage. Prefer
      sim-base if every sim should have it; otherwise scope to the
      single sim that needs it (the rtac-sim openssh-server +
      nginx pattern).
    Examples: rtac-sim's mbpoll for "from the RTAC" Modbus poll;
              rtac-sim's sshd + nginx for vendor → OT mgmt listeners.

Does the tool only exist to make the lab UI's auto-run button
work? (i.e. lab YAML has a fence the smoke would otherwise mark
as "no source container")
    → Same answer as above - pick the persona the lab tells the
      student they're on, not a different container that happens
      to already have the tool. Smoke gates rely on `node:` matching
      the actual image inventory.
```

Three guardrails:

1. **Smoke catches the simple case.** `scripts/lab-commands-smoke.sh`
   walks every command block in every lab YAML and execs it from the
   declared `node:` container. If the tool isn't there, the smoke
   fails. CI runs this on every PR - adding a command without
   adding the tool will fail the build.

2. **Don't sprawl image size.** Webtop images (eng-ws, vendor-jump)
   already carry a desktop environment; one more apt package is
   cheap. Alpine sims are minimal - every package added to sim-base
   costs across all six images. Scope tightly.

3. **Document when you add anything.** Update this matrix in the
   same PR. The whole point of this doc is that the next person
   doesn't have to grep four Dockerfiles to answer "where is X."
